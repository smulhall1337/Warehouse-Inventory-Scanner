# Warehouse Inventory Scanner

This was the project my team and I did for our Software Engineering class. 
The objective of the class was to give students their first taste of working with a team
in a SCRUM based environment, while giving them a real world project to undertake. 

My team went with the example project of the Warehouse Inventory Management System.
We picked this partly because it allowed us to tackle something with real world application, 
while also getting us familiar with a couple new concepts such as SQL.
